# phUNO

*UNO for free, online, multiplayer, with any rules*

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install` start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building

```bash
pnpm build
```

> You can preview the built app with `pnpm preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
